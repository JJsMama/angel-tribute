					<h5>Jul 23, 1923 - Jan 23, 2018</h5>
					<p>"Dear Opa;</p>
					<p>You are looking good! Your hair is perfect... hang on let me get that strand for you!
					You are one of the men that started this whole family! 2 children, 3 grandchildren and 8 great grandkids!
					I have always looked up to you with great respect! You are the bravest man I know for everything you've been through in your life and everything I learned about the war and what you went through! You are also one of the funniest men I know with all the jokes you've told!
					So many awesome memories! Playing tiles and you letting Oma slide the tile we need under the table so we could actually beat you..... going to Holland with a lot of memories, but my favourite was watching you and Oma try and close one of the suitcases! And you TRIED to get me to eat smoked eel.... croquets was the end result ðŸ˜„ all the bikes you had to put together for us.... the rides you went on with us at Woodbine Centre.... the water ride we went on in Holland where the only person who actually got wet was you, and the amount of pennies that you won from all of us playing cards!
					You taught me how to play solitaire, ride a bike and tell a joke!
					You are the best Opa anyone could ever ask for!
					We all love you to the moon and back!</p>

					<p>You are, and always will be, one of a kind! You always made sure, no matter what, that you made time for us. When you baby sat us when we were little, there were always fun things to do. Your house will always be one I drive by and have a lot of memories! You had a long and loving life! Til We Meet Again! Love you!"

					<h5>Nov 28, 1964 - Jan 31, 2020</h5>
					<p>"Dear Heather;</p>
					<p>You mean the world to me! You mean the world to a lot of people but I can say that my life would not even be close to the same without you. We really got to know each other in Barbados and became really close. When I had to move back home, you were my best friend here! You've done so much for me and my boys since they've been born and I can't thank you enough! You dont deserve this ending! And even though you dont deserve it, you fought the fight and had the best attitude towards it all the time! I love you to the moon and back! I dont want to say good bye, so I will, unwillingly, say see you later. I will miss our talks, bonfires, crowe trips and just your company! I will MISS you! When you get your wings, Say hi to Nana and Opa! ðŸ˜­ðŸ’œðŸ˜­ðŸ’œðŸ˜­ðŸ’œ
					Til we meet again, My Friend"
